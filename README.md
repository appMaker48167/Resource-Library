# Resource Library (GitHub-powered)

A lightweight, mobile-friendly web app that lists files from a GitHub repository, supports search & category filtering, and lets you **send/share** resource links via the device share sheet or email.

## Quick Start (Public Repo)
1. Edit `config.js` to set your GitHub repo info (already done in this copy for appMaker48167/sendnetwork-resources).
2. Deploy this app (the files in this folder) to **GitHub Pages**:
   - Create a new repo (e.g., `resource-library-app`)
   - Upload these files
   - Settings → Pages → Select Branch (e.g., `main` / `/root`) → Save
   - Your app will be live at: `https://YOUR_USER.github.io/resource-library-app/`
